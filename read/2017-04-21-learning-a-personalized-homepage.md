excerpt: >-
  > At Netflix we use personalization extensively and treat every situation as
  an opportunity to present the right content to each of our over 57 million
  members. The main way a member interacts with our recommendations is via the
  homepage, which they see when they log into Netflix on any supported device.
  The primary function of the homepage is to help each member easily find
  something to watch that they will enjoy. A problem we face is that our catalog
  contains many more videos than can be displayed on a single page and each
  member comes with their own unique set of interests. Thus, a general
  algorithmic challenge becomes how to best tailor each member's homepage to
  make it relevant, cover their interests and intents, and still allow for
  exploration of our catalog.
