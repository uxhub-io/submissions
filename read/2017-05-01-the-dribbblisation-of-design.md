> On one hand, we have some amazing pieces of writing from the likes of RyanSinger and Julie Zhuo, moving our craft forward. On the other hand, we have agrowing number of people posting and discussing their work on Dribbble, theaggregated results of which are moving our craft backwards. This post is notabout Dribbble itself, it’s about what the community on Dribbble value. I’lluse the term ‘product design’ throughout, but I’m including UX and interactiondesign when I do.
