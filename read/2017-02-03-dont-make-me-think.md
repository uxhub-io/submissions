> When I wrote Don’t Make Me Think, my intent was to help people learn to think like a usability expert: to ask the same questions that I have in mind when I’m trying to make something more usable.
>
> I believed that with a little bit of instruction most people could do a lot of what I do themselves, since much of it just seems like common sense once you hear it explained.
