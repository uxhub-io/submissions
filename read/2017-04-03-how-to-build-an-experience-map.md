Why build an experience map?

An Experience map helps the organisation to see the bigger picture, and make decisions about where to focus activity based on research. By seeing the bigger picture, youâ€™re able to:

* Identify projects and build a road map of work
* Identify opportunities for innovation
* Understand where the user experience is currently being well supported
