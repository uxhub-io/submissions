## The Effects Of Multiple Column Online Text On Reading Speed, Reading Comprehension, And Satisfaction

### Abstract

> This study examined the effects of the number of columns and type of justification on reading speed, reading comprehension, and satisfaction for online text. Sixty-six participants read a single narrative passage of approximately 2200 words presented in one of six conditions: one, two or three columns and full- or left-justification. Results from this study found that reading speeds for two-column full-justified condition and one-column left-justified condition were fastest overall. Fast readers performed best under the two column full-justified condition, and slow readers performed best under the one-column left-justified condition. No significant differences were found overall satisfaction or comprehension. Further studies are needed to examine the importance of individual difference in reading ability on online reading performance.
