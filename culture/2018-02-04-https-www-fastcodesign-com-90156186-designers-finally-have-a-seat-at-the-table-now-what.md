excerpt: >-
  About 15 years ago when I started at my first tech company, design was seen by
  most as an afterthought. Even as a senior designer, I wasn’t invited to
  meetings to present my work and couldn’t imagine anyone asking me to weigh in
  on a product decision. Flash forward to today, and many designers hold the
  coveted seat at the table we’ve long been dreaming of. We’re making key
  strategic decisions and helping to shape the direction of companies. We got
  here because we proved design can solve big problems in a way that others
  cannot. This is a victory, one that we earned through a lot of hard work, and
  we should be proud of ourselves.
