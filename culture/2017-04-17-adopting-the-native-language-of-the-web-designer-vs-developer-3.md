## Designer vs. Developer #3

Welcome to Designer Vs Developer, a show that tries to solve the challenges faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing take aways, solutions to workflows, tools & discussions on everyday struggles.

This week Mustafa speaks to Ade Oshineye, a Developer Advocate on the Google Developer Relations Team, about how the incorrect use of design language has influenced us to adopt the UX practices of the native app world and how the web should seek to create a native language of its own.
