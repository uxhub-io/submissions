- Good design is the creation of an experience that’s enjoyable, useful, easy and accessible – but it’s difficult to add functionality without increasing complexity.
- The right design choices are rarely obvious to designers themselves, but they should feel obvious to the end user.\r\n- When it comes to product team building, there’s no ideal ratio of designers to engineers. It shifts depending on where you are in achieving product market fit.
- Strong design principles should be controversial, because they should explain why your company made a decision that another wouldn’t.
- When two products accomplish a job with relatively similar ease at a similar price, the ultimate differentiator will be how the product makes the user feel. Design plays a huge part in that.
