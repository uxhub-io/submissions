## Designer vs. Developer #1

Welcome to Designer vs. Developer, a show that tries to solve the challenges faced in industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing take aways, solutions to workflows, tools & discussions on everyday struggles.

In this episode Mustafa Kurtuldu speaks to Jake Archibald about communication and the assumption that designers and developers sole role is to either make things look pretty or to be a cog in a machine with no soul.
