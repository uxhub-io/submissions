Welcome to Designer vs. Developer, a show that tries to solve the challenges faced in the industry by opening a conversation between the two, providing take aways, solutions to workflows, tools & discussions on everyday struggles. 

This week Mustafa speaks to Ewa Gasperowicz, Front End Developer on the Google Developer Relations Team, about whether the UX movement has over regulated the creative process and how we can bring back that sparkle into a project by making sandwiches.
