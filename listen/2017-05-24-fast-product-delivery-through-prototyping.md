Elden Nelson talks with Charles Plath and Mike Fagan of Instec, a company that develops custom software for insurance companies. Charles is Instec’s user experience director; Mike is vice president of product management. Together they explain how Instec uses prototyping and user insights to create products that meet the requirements of a regulated industry while helping customers differentiate themselves from their competitors. Instec offers fast time to market for its custom solutions, delivering wireframes and prototypes within weeks and initial versions of usable products within months. The company’s secret: agile development processes and Indigo Studio prototyping.
